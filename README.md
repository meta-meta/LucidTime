# LucidTime
## A Pebble Watch App

Are you dreaming? Are you dreaming right now? Learn to recognize when you are dreaming. Look away from your watch then look back. Notice anything strange? If you are dreaming, it's likely that the text won't make sense. It might appear as cryptic, meaningless glyphs. Often, when dreaming, digital displays will appear as gibberish when you really take a moment to look.

When you get in the habit of entertaining the possibility that you are dreaming at any given moment, the frequency of becoming lucid, i.e., recognizing that you are dreaming while you are dreaming, increases dramatically. 

### ཨ Set time between "reality checks" with + or - (long press to go by 20 minute intervals)

### ཨ Before bed, choose 8hr (your usual interval will resume in the morning) 

The app will "pinch" you and ask if you are dreaming. Even if you think you are awake, it's best to do one or more "reality checks" to be sure: 

### ཨ gently attempt to push two fingers through the palm of your other hand 

### ཨ hold your nose, close your mouth and try to breathe 

### ཨ look at a digital watch such as your Pebble

### ཨ flip a light switch 

When you are dreaming, you may be surprised that these things don't work as expected. If they don't, go explore your very own dream world!

What you can do in a dream is only limited by your imagination and as you become more familiar with dreaming, the limits of your imagination will expand.
